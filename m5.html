        <h2>About The BMW M5</h2>
        <p>The BMW M5 is a high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan category. The M5 has always been produced in the sedan (saloon) body style, but in some countries the M5 has also been available as a wagon (estate) from 1992 to 1995, from 2006 to 2010, and since 2024.

            The first M5 model was hand-built in 1985 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production sedan at the time. M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1985</p>
